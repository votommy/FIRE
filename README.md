# FIRE
A simple web program that tells you if/when you're able to retire early. As part of the FIRE movement (Financially Independent, Retire Early).

The program prompts for a handful of user inputs and uses those inputs to project the earliest date they can reach financial independence using a simple equation that calculates what it'll take for the interest of one's investments to completely cover their living expenses every year.

**Disclaimer**: *This program is only for theoretical application only, and should not be used for financial advice; consult a professional for real retirement advice & guidance.*
