# FIRE (beta)
A web program that tells you if/when you're able to retire early. As part of the [FIRE movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRE_movement) (Financially Independent, Retire Early).

The program prompts for a handful of user inputs and uses those inputs to project the earliest date they can reach financial independence using a simple equation that calculates what it'll take for the interest of one's investments to completely cover their living expenses every year.

**Disclaimer**: *This program is only for theoretical application only, and should not be used for financial advice; consult a professional for real retirement advice & guidance.*

I wrote this website as a way to showcase my UX abilities while applying something that I'm passionate about - personal finance. The goal of this project was to create an interactive user interface that was done completely in pure HTML with no help from tools such as Bootstrap or jQuery.
